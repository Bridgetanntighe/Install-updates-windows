<h1>Linux | Installing, Updating and Removing Software </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
There are three learning objectives for this lab: <br>

Update- The machine I used came preinstalled with an old version of the VLC Media Player. I updated VLC to the newest version. <br>

Install- l installed the Mozilla Firefox web browser. There was no version of Firefox on the machine beforehand. <br>

Uninstall - I uninstall the GIMP photo-editing tool from the machine, removing it entirely. <br>
<br />


<h2>Verifying installed software </h2>
1. Checked if Firefox is installed using the command ```dpkg-s```. This showed Firefox is not installed on the system. <br>
2. Checked if GIMP is installed. <br>
3. Ran ```dpkg -s vlc``` showed that vlc is installed but the version is out of date. <br>

<h2>Check file and Directory details:</h2>

The lab starts with ```/home/researcher2``` as the current working directory. This is because I changed permissions for files and directories belonging to the ```researcher2``` user. <br>
1. The ```cd``` projects command navigates to the projects directory. <br>
2. The ```ls -l``` command lists the contents and permissions of the projects directory. This shows the ```reserch_team``` owns the files in the projects directory.<br>
3. The ```ls -la``` command shows whether any hidden files exist in the projects directory. This shows the ```.project_x.txt``` file is hidden. <br>

<h2>Change file permissions:</h2>

This shows whether any files have incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action will remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system. <br>
1. Check whether any files in the projects directory have written permissions for the owner type with the ```ls -l``` command. This shows the ```project_k.txt``` file has write permissions for other users. <br>
2. I changed the permissions of the file identified in the previous step so that the owener type of other doesn't have write permissions. I used the ```chmod``` command for this. <br>
<b><i>Note - Permissions are granted for three different types of owners, namely user, group and other.</b></i> <br>
3. The file ```project_m.txt``` is a restricted file and should not be readable or writable by the group or other; only the user should have these permissions on this file. The ```ls -l``` command lists the contents and permissions of the current directory and check if the group has read or write permissions. This shows the group permissions of the ```project_m.txt``` file is read only. <br>
4. Using the ```chmod ```command changes permissions of the ```project_m.txt``` file so that the group doesnâ€™t have read or write permissions. <br>

<h2>Change file permissions on a hidden file:</h2>

Next I determined if a hidden file has incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action further remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system.<br>
The file ```.project_x.txt``` is a hidden file that has been archived and should not be written to by anyone. (The user and group should still be able to read this file.) <br>
1. Checking the permissions of the hidden file ```.project_x.txt``` and answer the question that follows. The command to complete this step is ```ls -la```. This shows the user and owner types have inncorrect write permissions. <br>
2. I changed the permissions of the file ```.project_x.txt``` so that both the user and the group can read, but not write to, the file using the ```chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt``` <br>
<b><i>Note - Always start the name of a hidden file with a period (.)</b></i> <br>

<h2>Change directory permissions:</h2>

Finally, I changed the permissions of a directory. First, I checked the group permissions of the ```/home/researcher2/projects/drafts``` directory and then modify the permissions as required. (It's important to be in the projects directory while managing the permissions of its subdirectory drafts.) <br>
Only the ```researcher2 ``` user should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. (This means that only ```researcher2``` should have execute privileges.) <br>
1. I checked the permissions of the drafts directory and answer the following question using the ```ls -l``` command. It shows the group has execute permissions and therefore has access to the drafts directory. <br>
2. I removed the execute permission for the group from the drafts directory with the ```chmod``` command.<br>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>
This demonstates practical experience using basic Linux Bash shell commands to

- examine file and directory permissions, <br>
- change permissions on files, and<br>
- change permissions on directories.
